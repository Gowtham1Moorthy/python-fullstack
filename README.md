# Lottery Purchase System

For a group project we were tasked at creating a way to purchase lottery tickets online for a client. We created a website that users can browse different kinds of lottery tickets, view previous orders, view previous winners, and purchase tickets. 

## Project Notes

During our Software Engineering class we had this project they went through the entire software development life cycle. We started off by creating a Software Requirement Specification (SRS). After completing that part we created this site.

## Features

- **Login/Sign Up:** Users create an account in order to user the system. Signing up is very easy and takes no time at all.
- **Browsing:** Users can browse all the tickets available for purchase.
- **Searching:** Users can search for a specific ticket.
- **Purchasing:** Once logged in, the system allows users to purchase tickets with valid card card information.
- **Previous Orders** A place where users can see their previous orders. They will be able to see the numbers the system gave to them. They can also see if a ticket they purchased was a winner. If it was a winner, users can claim their winnings from this page.
- **Previous Winners:** On this page you can see previous winners name, amount won, and the date they won.
- **Profile:** Users can change different information that is associated with their account.
- **Admin Functionalities:** Those who login with an admin account can add new tickets, edit existing tickets, and delete old tickets. Claim Centers can also login to our system that to mark off if a users has claimed their winnings if the amount is above $599.
- **Mobile Responsive:** OThe site is accessible on all devices as since we made the page scale to all different screen widths.

## Usage

1. In the main project folder, run `py manage.py runserver` in order to start the site.
